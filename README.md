## Scenes theme
For my scene, I have a triangle, circle-ish shape, and a square. I plan to make a firework scene where the triangle represents a mountain, the circle represents the firework explosion, and the square will eventually represent a house.

## Note:
I tried both obfuscators, but they only draw the triangle for some reason, They recognize my new pipeline objects (checked with inspect page console) but do not render the circle or square.
